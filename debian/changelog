skanlite (0.3-2) unstable; urgency=low

  The »KDE team and mentors appreciation« release.

  [ Kai Wasserbäch ]
  * debian/rules:
    - Ensure minimal linking (some unneeded liking we can't get around
      otherwise): set »DEB_KDE_LINK_WITH_AS_NEEDED='yes'«.
    - Remove the »rm« line from the install target, shouln't have been there
      at all. I somehow made the mistake to assume, that the symlinked
      directory should be shipped by the package too. (Where is that brown
      paper bag?)
    - Added »DEB_DH_ALWAYS_EXCLUDE« for some VCS files to be always excluded.
  * debian/watch: make the KDE version part variable too, without getting into
    the way of version comparison.
  * Added a German manpage. 
  * Corrected/Unified capitalisation of the program's name, it's officially
    »Skanlite«.
