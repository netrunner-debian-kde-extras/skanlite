skanlite (0.3-2) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  The »KDE team and mentors appreciation« release.

  [ Mark Purcell ]
  * NOT RELEASED YET

  [ Kai Wasserbäch ]
  * debian/rules:
    - Ensure minimal linking (some unneeded liking we can't get around
      otherwise): set »DEB_KDE_LINK_WITH_AS_NEEDED='yes'«.
    - Remove the »rm« line from the install target, shouln't have been there
      at all. I somehow made the mistake to assume, that the symlinked
      directory should be shipped by the package too. (Where is that brown
      paper bag?)
  * debian/watch: make the KDE version part variable too, without getting into
    the way of version comparison.
