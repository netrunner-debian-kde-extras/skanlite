skanlite (0.3-kde4.3.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  The »Cryptic Command« release.

  * New upstream release.
  * debian/control:
    - Standard-Version is now 3.8.3, no changes needed.
    - Versioned Build-Depends for debhelper and pkg-kde-tools.
    - Drop cdbs from Build-Depends.
  * debian/rules: rewritten for dh7-only build.
  * debian/watch: rewritten to care for the second version part too. We
    mangled/ignored that so far, but as there are minor updates indicated by
    that, we need to check that too.

skanlite (0.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial release (Closes: #530915)
    The combined »Article 5 Grundgesetz was murdered« and
    »KDE team and mentors appreciation« release.

  [ Mark Purcell ]
  * debian/watch -> svn-upgrade
  * Maintainer: kde-extras & add myself to uploaders
  * Section: graphics, Update Vcs
  * Switch to debian/skanlite.manpages
  * Switch to cdbs

  [ Kai Wasserbäch ]
  * debian/control: Standards-Version is now 3.8.2, no changes needed.
  * debian/copyright:
    - Use the KDE version of the GPL header.
    - doc{,-translations}: the documentation in these directories is licensed
      under the GNU GFDL 1.2 with no non-DFSG compliant parts.
  * debian/rules:
    - Ensure minimal linking (some unneeded linking we can't get around
      otherwise): set »DEB_KDE_LINK_WITH_AS_NEEDED='yes'«.
    - Remove the »rm« line from the install target, shouln't have been there
      at all. I somehow made the mistake to assume, that the symlinked
      directory should be shipped by the package too. (Where is that brown
      paper bag?)
    - Added »DEB_DH_ALWAYS_EXCLUDE« for some VCS files to be always excluded.
  * debian/watch: make the KDE version part variable too, without getting into
    the way of version comparison.
  * Manpages:
    - Added an English manpage.
    - Added a German manpage. 
  * Corrected/Unified capitalisation of the program's name, it's officially
    »Skanlite«.
  * Lintian override »skanlite: arch-dep-package-has-big-usr-share« added.
    (largest part are translations (mo) and they are not really independent, if
    I remember correctly (e.g. bit ordering).
